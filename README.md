# Word-Guess-Game

This is a game like hangman, you must guess the random word generated by the comupter by pressing the key associated that you choose. There is 10 trys to get the word correctly before it goes to the next randomly picked word. 

This project was useful because I am starting to understand how to put things togethter so I have a work webpage that is interactive. 

Uses can start the game by hiting any key 

Uses can use my project to see how to use for loops, if statements, how to break a word into letters, track win losses, count down by letters keyed, and only show letters if they are keyed correctly.

I maintain this project and had help from my TA's.
